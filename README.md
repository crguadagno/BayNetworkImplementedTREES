# BayNetworkImplementedTREES

This repository contains input and output files to the Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator model (https://github.com/DRWang3/leaf_model_TREES_paper) used to test the concept of informing biophysical parameters with transcriptomic information.

* .txt file contains the metereological drivers

* .p files are model parameters

* param_mod file describes the plant hydraulic architecture (e.g., root layers, depths)

The manuscript is currently in revision and the reference will be updated accordingly:
