# BayNetworkImplementedTREES

This repository contains input and output files to the Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator model used to test the concept of informing biophysical parameters with transcriptomic information. TREES version 3.0 utilized for this study may be found here: https://github.com/DRWang3/leaf_model_TREES_paper

Files in this repository:

* .txt file contains the metereological drivers

* .p files are model parameters

* param_mod file describes the plant hydraulic architecture (e.g., root layers, depths)

The manuscript is currently in revision and the reference below will be updated accordingly.
